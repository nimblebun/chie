# chie

`chie` is a powerful tool for decrypting/encrypting, parsing, and analyzing Cave
Story's TSC format. The goal is to create a tool that can be used universally
for working with TSC files (i.e. in the [TSC Language Server][tsc-ls-url]) or a
dedicated TSC linter).

This library is a work in progress.
